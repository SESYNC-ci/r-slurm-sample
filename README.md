This is sample code for submitting an R script to SESYNC's computational cluster. 

Complete instructions for using this example are located at: http://goo.gl/ytwLnN

You can use this project as a starting point for your own code by cloning it and editing the submit.sh file as appropriate. You can submit your job to our cluster by logging on to our R Studio Server and running:

system("sbatch submit.sh")
